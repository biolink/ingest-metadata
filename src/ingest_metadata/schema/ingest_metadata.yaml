title: KGX Ingest Metadata Schema
description: >-
  A schema for describing metadata about a specific execution of a source ingest to produce a specific KGX-format graph.
comment: >-
  An ingest metadata file holds information about a specific execution of an ingest of a given source - of which there may be many over time, to produce different instances KGX outputs.
  A RIG describes more general specification and rationale for ingesting a given source, that is mean to apply across any specific ingest execution.
  Content of these two descriptive artifacts is intended to be complementary / non-overlapping.
